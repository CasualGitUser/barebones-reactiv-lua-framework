# barebones-reactiv-lua-framework
A barebones framework that contains reactive streams and signals. The signals have the same operators (map, filter etc.) as streams and also have onEvent function (which you can think of as a onChange function).

### Importing
A code example best demonstrates this:

```lua
local ReactiveModule = require(PathToReactiveModule)
local Reactive = Reactive.Reactive -- reactive streams
local Signal = Reactive.Signal -- signals, aka variables with a :onEvent function to react to changes

-- here comes your code
```

### Constructors
Those are the constructor functions of reactive streams:
- `Reactive.new()`: doesn't emit anything, you need to :emit() yourself
- `Reactive.fromInstance(instance)`: everytime a property of instance changes it emits the changed property (for                                        example it would emit `"Position"` when the Position property changes).
- `Reactive.fromInterval(seconds)`: emits nil every `seconds` seconds.
- `Reactive.fromRBXScriptSignal(rbx_script_signal)`: Everytime the `rbx_script_signal` emits, the returned stream emits too together with the values. That holds true even for multiple values. That simply means when using operators/onevent the function you pass in takes 2 or more values.
- 

### Emitting and Reacting
- `Reactive:emit(value1, value2, ...)`: Used to emit values. Takes 0 or more arguments.
- `Reactive:onEvent(listener: <T>(T) -> ())`: Takes a listener takes the value that the stream emits and returns nothing.

### Operators
Operators always return new streams (operators are pure methods).

As in the name of this github mentioned, there aren't many operators.
- `Reactive:map(f: <A, B>(A) -> B)`: Returns a new `Reactive` stream that emits the mapped values.
- `Reactive:flatMap(f: <A, B>(A) -> Reactive<B>)`: Returns a new `Reactive` stream that flatmaps the returned values. Aka, everytime the value f returned (which is a stream) emits, it emits the value in the flatMapped stream too.
- `Reactive:filter(predicate: <T>(T) -> boolean)`: Returns a new `Reactive stream` that emits only values that pass the given predicate.
- `Reactive:scan(init, f: <T>(acc, T) -> acc`: <p> - init: the value acc has on the first emit. <p> - f: Takes the accumulator as the first argument and the emitted value as the second argument. Returns the new value of the accumulator, which gets emitted in the stream returned from :scan.
- `Reactive:merge(...)`: Merges the given streams. Everytime one of the merged streams (or self) emits a value, it emits the value in the returned stream too.
- `Reactive:skipUntil(predicate: <T>(T) -> boolean)`: Doesn't emit the itmes in the returned stream until one passes the predicate, after which it emits all items the original stream emits.
- `Reactive:buffer(duration)`: Returns a stream that emits every `duration` seconds a array of all the values emitted in `duration` seconds or nothing if nothing got emitted in `duration` seconds.

## Signals
I don't advise using the Signals provided by this module. They work, but if you think about it: what does filtering or buffering a signal really mean? In the case of buffering, it really just emits x references to signal.value. The usefulness is questionable, but i provide it anyway since i coded it already.

### Signal specific constructors
- `Reactive.fromValueBase(value_base: ValueBase)`: Returns a Signal that changes everytime the value_base object changes.
- `Reactive.fromAttribute(object: Instance, attribute: string)`: Returns a signal that changes everytime the attribute value changes.
